Project Title: react-todo-app

Project Description:  

This Tic Tac Toe app was developed based upon the React tutorial @ https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview 

I updated the client rendering api code from React 17 to React 18 syntax as ReactDOM is deprecated in React 18. I also rewrote all the functions in ES6 javascript syntax and made some very minor adjustments to the css. I built this app to continue to learn and practice my react.js skills.

In this app we have a simple interface that allows us to play tic tac toe. The current player's turn is displayed as well as a history of all of the moves made. The game may be reverted back to a pervious state at any time using the move buttons or start a new game using the appropriate button.
